## M & E

Article is talking about:
Why we can't master english?

There mostly are two reasons:

### Wrong Input & output

Image our english skill is like a function, it receive symbols like a photo, voice or some text in a book. and it return the meaning of symbols.
Improve english skill means that do sth make the function's result is more accuracy.

So, if we practice with wrong methods, it may be useless for improve the accuracy of this 'function'.

For example, in China, there are a lot of application which is helping us to memorize words. However, the words we memorized result is Chinese explanation instead of the real meaning of the words. Even if we get the right input, but we get wrong output. So, it helpless to really master English. Because the connection between meaning and English words is not created.

### Wrong practice method

There are two main types of factors that cause people to react:
    Brain Thinking & Muscle memory

In biological evolution, creatures took the lead in mastering the way of muscle memory (I'm not sure if is the correct way to translate). Muscle memory is something like DO SPORTS, PLAY THE INSTRUMENT or another. These behaviors don't require the brain thinking. It's fast but no accuracy.

Brain Thinking is other way to take a reaction. Obviously, brain thinking need we use our brain to think. Brain think is something like TAKE A EXAM, prove a theory or talk with another person and so on. It's slow but more accuracy.

Learn a language is more like the former. We don't need to carefully analyze grammar or word tenses, but know what the other party wants to express. So, If we want to truly master a language, we should practice the feeling for the language rather than continually analyzing word by word.

### Wrong memorize struct

We know, the most efficient method to memorize is remember something by group. Therefore, If we only memorize words or sentences in fragments, it will be difficult for us to truly remember them for a long time.
