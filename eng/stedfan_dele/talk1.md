1. Plan of our course in the future

# Plan

## Target
~100 score TOEFL at 09.2024
probably sounds like a fantasy

## Personal level based on self-evaluation
Have not taken the exam: TOEFL

1. Reading (relatively good)
   Because I almostly use Englsh in learning CS. Browse community sites, such as Reddit, Quora. Sometimes I also read papers. Twitter's content is difficult to understand because there are a lot of abbreviation vocabulary or slang.
2. Listening (not bad)
   Listen ytb or CS course every day (at last year)
   But only be familiar with CS relative vocabulary
3. Speaking (bad)
   Almostly not used. Recent focus on this and writing.
4. Writing (VERY POOOR!)
   Probably the longest sentence I event wrote was using a search engine. Or using programming Language (haha).
   Maybe I will use ChatGPT to help me improve my English Writing Skill. 

## Goal at our course

3 times a week
Get used to English conversation

an articles's inspiring opinion:
mother tongue weaning
This means that I should be used to think in mind by using English without Chinese.

So I don't want to spend too much time to learning such as Gramma or vocabulary itself. Maintaining interest and a sense of accomplishment is most important.
