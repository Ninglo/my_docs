how should I call you

自我介绍
Hello! My name is JiaNian Jiu, and I come from Luoyang, Henan, China. I was born in the year 2000. Currently, I work in Beijing as a software developer engineer at Bytedance, also known as TikTok.

I am considering studying in the United States or Canada. Because I am born in a updeveloped area, I've faced limitations in terms of the time dedicated to learning English in school. To be honest, I've had minimal times to take conversations with others. So I am determined to improve my English skill, especially in listening and speaking. That's why I've decided to engage in more conversations with people like you to practice and enhance my language abilities.
