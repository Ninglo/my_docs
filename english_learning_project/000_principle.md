To be honest, I have to say that learning English probably is the thing which spend my most time. However, it is still a bit difficult for me to truly use English to reading or listening and speaking and writing. But I believe that I am already running in a happy path, because I can fluently read article or books about Computer Science. I think that I'm already build a abstract language framework in English. Only one more thing between me and acquiring English is familiar with more and more domain knowledge in English.
So, at the end day of 2023, I write this article to express my opinion about learning English. In the next half a year, I plan to acquire definitely frequently English ability. I will record the progress of learning each week (Maybe each day is a better choice, but I'm not sure whether I can do that). If I can achieve this goal, I think it also can inspire another one that learning English isn't like as scary as it look like.
Hope I can achieve my goal!
