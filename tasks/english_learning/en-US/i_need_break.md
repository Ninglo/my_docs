It's obvious that I sometimes lose control, maybe once a month or once a week. Therefore, the most important thing is to find a 'brake,' which means that when I am losing control, I can use a method to adjust my state immediately.
From previous experience, I believe that watching certain videos or being around someone who maintains a rational demeanor can also impact me. So, in the past few months, I think the first thing I should do is find more rational people to influence me.
