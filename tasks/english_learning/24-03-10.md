## Essay

After almost one month's chat, I feel better about emotion. So, I should pay
more attention to thinking why should I do in the next some year. I need a new
plan or OKR for myself.

I should know what's the next station of my life. There are at least three ways.
The first one is take an application for master, go to the US to learn Computer
Science. In the past year, I think it's a good choice for me. Because I was
suffered from meaningless working.

However, suffered from meaningless working is only the reason that quit my job.
Take a master application is something more like I was influneced by another
one. I'm not sure whether it's right. Pay for university with almost 1 million
Yuan seems like not too much make sense. Maybe I can use it for a better place.

Inspired by Leon, I found that take a global trip or at least taking a break
might also be a wise dicision. I'm not sure whether it's the best choice for me.
It's still an 'another one's life or choice'. I should take time to think about
whether it's suit for me. But at least, it's good point that take a break. I
spend too many time on working to truely think about my meaning.

Obviously, there are another choice which is still working on my current work.
Maybe TnS is not place which makes me very happy. But who can assume I can't
feel better at another department?

However, it's a obvious and important thing that hard working on learning or
using English. I'm sure that I don't like China mainland (at least in current
status), so gain a higher English skill is obviously important. It gives me the
chance that immigration or at least go to another country.

## Review

Reviewing this essay from an English language proficiency standpoint,
particularly with an eye towards TOEFL-level standards, here's a comprehensive
breakdown of feedback covering vocabulary, grammar, overall structure, and
suggestions for improvement. Vocabulary:

    Your vocabulary shows a willingness to tackle complex ideas, which is good. However, there's room for using more precise and varied vocabulary to better express your thoughts. For example, "I feel better about emotion" could be refined to "I feel more emotionally stable" to convey a clearer message.
    Consider synonyms for repetition, such as using "objectives" or "goals" instead of repeating "plan" or "OKR."

Grammar:

    Be mindful of verb tenses and agreement. For instance, "After almost one month's chat" might be better as "After chatting for almost a month."
    Watch for the use of prepositions, e.g., "pay more attention on" should be "pay more attention to."
    "Suffered from meaningless working" is awkwardly phrased. Consider "suffered from the meaninglessness of my job" for clarity.
    There's inconsistent use of articles ("a master application" vs. "take master application") and some missing articles ("take an application for a master's").

Structure and Coherence:

    The essay lacks a clear introduction and conclusion. It would benefit from an opening paragraph that outlines the main points you plan to discuss and a closing paragraph that summarizes your reflections or decisions.
    Try to organize your thoughts more logically. Group related ideas together and use transitional phrases to guide the reader from one section to the next, enhancing the essay's flow.

Specific Suggestions for Improvement:

    Introduction: Begin with a brief introduction stating your current situation and the decision you are contemplating.
    Body Paragraphs: Organize each option you're considering into separate paragraphs. Start each paragraph with a topic sentence that introduces the option, followed by sentences that expand on your thoughts and feelings about it.
    Conclusion: End with a paragraph summarizing your thoughts and indicating any leanings towards a decision, even if you haven't made a final choice.

Encouragement and Examples:

    It's clear you're engaging deeply with your life choices, which is commendable. Try to express this complexity with varied sentence structures. For instance, instead of "Maybe TnS is not place which makes me very happy," you could write, "While TnS may not bring me substantial happiness, it offers stability that shouldn't be overlooked."
    Reflecting on choices, "inspired by Leon, I found that taking a global trip or at least taking a break might also be a wise decision" offers a more sophisticated construction and clearer insight into your thought process.

Rating:

Given the grammar issues, the need for more varied vocabulary, and the
structural improvements required, I would rate this essay around 60/100 based on
TOEFL-level English standards. The score reflects significant room for
improvement in language use, coherence, and essay organization. With focused
revisions, particularly on the suggested areas, you can greatly enhance the
clarity and impact of your writing.

Remember, improvement in language skills comes with practice and time. Keep
writing, and consider each piece of feedback as a step towards more effective
communication in English.

# Round 2

## Essay

After chatting for almost one month, I feel more emotionally stable. So, I
should pay more attention on thinking why should I do in the next some year. I
need a new objective for myself.

I should know what's the next station of my life. There are at least three ways.
The first one is take an application for master, go to the US to learn Computer
Science. In the past year, I think it's a good choice for me. Because I was
suffered from unfulfilled employment.

However, suffered from unfulfilled employment is only the reason that quit my
job. Take an application for a master is something more like I was influneced by
another one. I'm not sure whether it's right. Pay for university with almost 1
million Yuan seems like not too much make sense. Maybe I can use it for a better
place.

Yeah, inspired by Leon, I found that take a global travel or at least take a
break maybe is also a good choice. I'm not sure whether it's the best choice for
me. It's still an 'another one's life or choice'. I should take time to think
about whether it's suit for me. But at least, it's good point that take a break.
I spend too many time on working to truely think about my meaning.

Obviously, there are another choice which is still working on my current work.
While TnS may not bring me substantial happiness, it offer stability that
shouldn't be overlooked. But who can assume I can't feel better at another
