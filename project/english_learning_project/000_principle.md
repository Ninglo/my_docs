To be honest, I must admit that learning English is probably what I spend most of my time on. However, I still find it somewhat difficult to use English effectively for reading, listening, speaking, and writing. But I believe I am on a rewarding path, as I can fluently read articles and books about Computer Science. I think that I have already built an abstract language framework in English. The only thing standing between me and mastering English is becoming more familiar with domain-specific knowledge in English.

So, on the final day of 2023, I am writing this article to express my thoughts on learning English. In the next six months, I plan to significantly improve my English proficiency. I will record my learning progress weekly (perhaps daily would be a better choice, but I'm not certain I can commit to that). If I can achieve this goal, I believe it may also inspire others by showing that learning English is not as daunting as it may seem.

I hope I can achieve my goal!
