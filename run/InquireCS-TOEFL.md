Subject: Inquiry Regarding MSc in Computer Science Application Requirements

Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is JiaNian Jiu, a prospective student from China, writing to inquire about the application process for the Computer Science (MSc) program.

I am currently employed as a full-time Software Development Engineer at TikTok, where I have accumulated two years of experience. My role involves substantial software development responsibilities. I discovered my passion for computer science when I was learning my undergraduate studies in Pharmaceutical Analysis at China Pharmaceutical University(211). Despite the lack of relevant coursework during my undergraduate program, I dedicated significant time to self-study in computer science, leading to my successful entry into TikTok and my current role as a Software Development Engineer.

Considering my professional background in computer science and practical experience, I am interested in knowing whether work experience in the computer science field can be considered as an alternative to the undergraduate degree requirement for the MSc in Computer Science. Additionally, I would like to address that my undergraduate GPA is 3.06/4, reflecting the disparity in my academic background. I understand the importance of GPA, and I would appreciate guidance on whether individuals with a similar background are eligible to apply for the MSc in Computer Science program.

Furthermore, I have recently achieved an TOEFL iBT score of 95, meeting the English language proficiency requirements of the university.

Could you please advise me on whether my unique circumstances qualify me for the MSc in Computer Science program? Your insights on this matter would be highly valuable to me.

I appreciate your time and consideration. If you require any additional information, please feel free to contact me at jojiu7609@outlook.com.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your guidance.

Sincerely,
JiaNian Jiu
