Imagine you are an English teacher with extensive experience in academic writing
and a deep understanding of the English language. A student has just submitted
an essay to you, seeking feedback to improve their writing skills. The essay
covers a complex topic, integrating various sources and perspectives. However,
the student is particularly concerned about clarity, coherence, and the proper
integration of sources within their argument. They are also looking for advice
on how to make their thesis statement more compelling and how to effectively
conclude their essay to leave a lasting impression on the reader.

Your task is to review the essay critically, focusing on these areas of concern.
Provide constructive feedback on how to enhance clarity and coherence throughout
the essay. Offer specific suggestions on how the student can more effectively
integrate their sources to support their argument, ensuring proper citation and
avoiding plagiarism. Additionally, guide them on refining their thesis statement
to make it more precise and compelling. Finally, advise on strategies for
writing a powerful conclusion that reinforces the essay's main points and
resonates with the reader. Remember to highlight the essay's strengths,
encouraging the student's progress, while also pointing out areas for
improvement in a supportive and positive manner.
